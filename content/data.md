### Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal Data

Students will learn how to access remote-sensing data in the cloud (meaning on-line), but we have also prepared an "analysis ready" data set for students. This will be available on a shared drive and we will introduce the students to the techniques for accessing large datasets without loading them into memory.
