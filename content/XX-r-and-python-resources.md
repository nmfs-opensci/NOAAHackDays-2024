## Programming in R

The following give a basic intro to R and RStudio.

* [W3Schools Basic R](https://www.w3schools.com/r/default.asp)

* [Basics of R and installing RStudio](https://www.udemy.com/course/r-basics/)

* [YouTube: R for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDRa82lxzaU)


### Beyond the basics of R

* [Software Carpentry Novice R](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/)

* [Software Carpentry Intro to R](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/)

* For a longer free course, CodeAcademy has a good [Intro to R](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-r). Note this is 20 hours. You do NOT need to do this whole course before the hackweek! 

* If you know the basics of R but have never done modeling, then you can start with this [2.5 hour course](https://www.udemy.com/course/machlearn1) that covers basic linear regression with R and plotting with ggplot2: 

* One of the best free R courses is [Coursera's Learn R](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming). You can see the lectures for free. Make sure to click AUDIT when it asks you to sign up for a 7-day trial. You do not need to sign up for anything to go through the material.
