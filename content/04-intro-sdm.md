## Big Picture

In the broader context, our goal is to uncover where species are likely to be found, not just for their protection but also to strategically plan conservation efforts and to help manage fisheries. We aim to discover where these species are located and anticipate how their habitats might shift in the future.

But handling all this data manually is virtually impossible. It's like trying to piece together a complex puzzle with millions of tiny pieces.

Species Distribution Modeling (SDM) combined with big data analytics comes into play. SDM helps us make sense of this vast environmental data. We can extract meaningful patterns and relationships between the environment and species distribution. 

## NASA ARSET

I am going to be showing some slides from NASA ARSET' Training Course on Species Distribution Modeling ([here](https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/get-involved/training/english/arset-species-distribution-modeling-remote-sensing). This is a 4.5 hour webinar focusing on an R package called Wallace, which I won't be talking about as it is more focused on land SDMs. But the first lecture gives a good general overview of SDMs.

[NASA ARSET](https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/what-we-do/capacity-building/arset) is the NASA Applied Remote Sensing Training (ARSET) Program and they have virtual and on-line trainings for using remote-sensing data. Their [Fundamentals of Remote Sensing Course](https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/get-involved/training/english/arset-fundamentals-remote-sensing) is a good overview.
