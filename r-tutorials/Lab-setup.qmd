For initial set-up, you will need to create an folder `sdm-labs` and then create an RStudio project in that folder. Then every day, when you work on the tutorials, you will copy the tutorial into that folder. That copy is what you can alter, save and render (create html).

## Set up a new project

You will need to create a directory called `sdm-labs` in your home directory. You home directory is called `home/jovyan`. Navigate there and then click the New Folder icon and create `sdm-labs`.

Create an RStudio project at the sdm-labs directory. Go to

File > New Project > Existing directory 

Then navigate to the `sdm-labs` directory and create the project.

### Create a data folder

Within the `sdm-labs` directory, also create a folder called `data`. You will store data there.

## Returning to your project

When you reopen RStudio, it should go to the last project that you had open. But if not you can select the `sdm-labs` project by click the "blue cube" dropdown in the top right and selecting the `sdm-labs` project.

## Copy the lab into the `sdm-labs` directory

The R tutorials are in the folder `r-tutorials` in the `shared/2023-Hackbook` directory. You can open the lab we are working on in that directory and run the code, but you will not be able to save your work. There are 2 ways you can save your work.

### Open file and save when ready

You can work in the file in the `r-tutorials` directory as long as you don't "Render" the document. If you try to do that, it will complain that you do not have write permission.

So you work in the file and run code with the "Run" icon and then when you want to save, use File > Save As. Then navigate to your `\home\jovyan\sdm-labs` directory and save there.

### Save the file first

* Navigate to the `r-notebooks` folder
* Select the file you will be using by clicking the check box

* Click the Cog icon and select "Copy to"
* Copy to to your `\home\jovyan\sdm-labs` directory.

![Copy to](img/rstudio-copy-to.png){width="189"}

Now navigate to the `sdm-labs` folder and open the file.
