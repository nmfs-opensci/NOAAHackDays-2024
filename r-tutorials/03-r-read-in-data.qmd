::: {.callout-note icon=false}

## Goals for today

* Read in a csv or Excel file and create a "data.frame"
* Get column names and select a column
* Get size of the data frame
* Find the class of the data frame
* Save the data frame
* Read in some occurence data from robis
* Ask ChatGPT how to plot
* Ask ChatGPT how to clean up the date

## Syntax tips

`xyz::fun()` means function `fun()` in the `xyz` package. I will often use this when I don't want to call `library()` to load the whole `xyz` package. Why? Because remembering to call `library()` slows me down and when I forget I get errors. Instead I tend to load the major packages (like `library(tidyverse)` and `library(sf)`) for which I need many functions.

## File not found

The top error for new users is "File not found." You know they file is there, but R says "File not found."  File locations are relative to your current location. **Your current location if you are in a Quarto or Rmarkdown file is the folder with that file!** This means that code that works on the command line, fails in a Quarto or RMarkdown document. Oh no!

Try this in the Quarto document versus in the Console tab.
```{r eval=FALSE}
getwd()
```

This means that a normal file location can break:


* `.` Current location
* `..` Back one folder
* `folder name` Enter this folder
* `~` Home directory

```
./data/myfile.csv
```
means current location > data folder > myfile.csv in that folder. But if your current location changes, that code breaks.


### Solution 1 - full file path

Always use the full file path:

```
~/r-tutorials/data/myfile.csv
```
Home > r-tutorials folder > data folder > myfile.csv

This works until you move the `r-tutorials` folder somewhere else.

### Solution 2: the here package

This is the what experienced R users use. `here()` is the location of the base of your project. As long as you are in an RStudio project, it will return the base of that project.

This is what mine shows (I am on my laptop). It is the same inside a Quarto document, at the console and in scripts.
```{r}
here::i_am("r-tutorials/03-r-read-in-data.qmd")
here::here()
```

Now to specify a data file, I use
```{r}
fil <- here::here("r-tutorials", "data", "myfile.csv")
fil
```
This fully specifies the file location.

### Don't use `setwd()`

This changes your working directory and although it seems to help in the short-run, it causes all kinds of problems later.


## Import a csv file

We will use the Import Dataset widget in the Environment tab.

1. Click the Environment tag and then Import Dataset
2. Choose "From Text (readr)"
3. Browse to `obis_seamap_green.csv` in the `data` folder.
4. You should now see a preview of the data.

![](./img/R-import-widget.png)

Ok first thing we see is that we have 2 lines at the top of our data file. Put 2 in the Skip box to skip past those. Now the data and column headers should look right.

Notice that it also shows us the R code. We can copy that and run it directly if we wanted. But we can also just click the Import button.

### R Code

The import box helpfully shows us the R code to use. But this will break inside a Quarto file because the file path is wrong. This works in the Console or a script but not in a Quarto or RMarkdown file.

```
library(readr)
obis_seamap_green <- read_csv("r-tutorials/data/obis_seamap_green.csv", 
    skip = 2)
```

Let's make this code more robust:

```{r}
library(readr)
fil <- here::here("r-tutorials", "data", "obis_seamap_green.csv")
obis_seamap_green <- read_csv(fil, 
    skip = 2)
```

### Show the data

```{r}
obis_seamap_green
```

## Get the columns

Column names.

```{r}
colnames(obis_seamap_green)
```

We select a column with `$` like so. Notice how RStudio suggest the names.
```{r}
obis_seamap_green$date_time
```

Let's get one value.
```{r}
obis_seamap_green$date_time[1]
```

## Get the size

```{r}
dim(obis_seamap_green)
```

Let's make it a bit smaller. Select the first 500 rows because it takes a long time to plot otherwise.

```{r}
obis_seamap_green <- obis_seamap_green[1:500,]
```

## Look at the top of the file

```{r}
head(obis_seamap_green)
```

## Let's load new data from robis

Specify a bounding box.
```{r message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(sf)
extent_polygon <- sf::st_bbox(c(xmin = 41.875, xmax = 65.125, 
                            ymax = -0.125, ymin = 32.125), 
                          #Assign reference system
                          crs = sf::st_crs(4326)) %>% st_as_sfc()
pol_geometry <- sf::st_as_text(extent_polygon[[1]])
pol_geometry
```

Let's get some sharks and rays data. Sharks and rays in Bay of Bengal [ref1](https://www.tbsnews.net/environment/nature/studying-sharks-and-rays-bay-bengal-340471) [ref2](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276460309_Sharks_and_rays_fisheries_of_the_Bay_of_Bengal_at_the_landing_centers_of_Chittagong_and_Cox's_Bazar_Bangladesh) [ref3](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276460309_Sharks_and_rays_fisheries_of_the_Bay_of_Bengal_at_the_landing_centers_of_Chittagong_and_Cox's_Bazar_Bangladesh)

```{r}
fil <- here::here("r-tutorials", "data", "sharks.csv")
if(!exists(fil)){
sharks <- c("Scoliodon laticaudus", "Sphrna lewin", "Rhizoprionodon acutus", "Chiloscyllium indicum", "Galeocerdo cuvier", "Carcharhinus melanopterus", "Carcharhinus falciformis", "Rhizoprionodon acutus", "Carcharhinus leucas", "Carcharhinus  sorrah")
obs <- robis::occurrence(sharks, geometry = pol_geometry)
readr::write_csv(obs, file=here::here("r-tutorials", "data", "sharks.csv"))
}else{
  obs <- readr::read_csv(fil)
}
```

Now we can explore what kind of shark data we have for these species found in the Bay of Bengal study.

```{r}
library(mapview)
require(dplyr)
library(sf)
obs_sf <- obs[1:100,] %>% as_tibble() %>% 
  st_as_sf(coords = c("decimalLongitude", "decimalLatitude"), crs = 4326)
mapview(obs_sf, col.regions = "gray") + mapview(extent_polygon)
```

## Ask ChatGPT

When you are starting to code, you will not know how to do things. Obviously I can tell you but that won't help you when I am not here. Instead I'll have you ask a bot because the bot will be here when I am not. Also this is how people code now that AI is here to be our personal coding assistant.

Open <https://chat.openai.com/> and login. It's free.

Paste this into the Chat box.

```
I have a data.frame named obis_seamap_green with columns scientific, latitude, longitude, and platform. How do I make a histogram of the platform types? Only show the code. I want to use tidyverse.
```

ChatGPT returns this (or something similar)

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

obis_seamap_green %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = platform)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Platform Types", x = "Platform Type", y = "Frequency")
```

Hmm that look weird? How many platform types are there? Let's ask ChatGPT.

```
How do I find out the values for platform in my file
```

ChatGPT will return something like
```{r}
unique_platforms <- unique(obis_seamap_green$platform)
```
and we have to type 
```{r}
unique_platforms
```
to see the values. Oh, there is only one value.

## Make a map

Let's get ChatGPT to help us map our points.

"how can I make a map with my latitude longitude values on it"
    ChatGPT will most likely show you ggplot2 code like so

```{r}
# Install and load necessary packages (if not already installed)
# install.packages("ggplot2")
# install.packages("maps")
library(ggplot2)
library(maps)

# Assuming your data frame is named "obis_seamap_green"
# Replace "latitude" and "longitude" with your actual column names

# Create a basic map
world_map <- map_data("world")

# Plot latitude and longitude points on the map
ggplot(obis_seamap_green, aes(x = longitude, y = latitude)) +
  geom_polygon(data = world_map, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group), fill = "white", color = "black") +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Map of Latitude and Longitude Points")
```

* Tell ChatGPT: "The map is the whole world and my points are in one small region. How can I fix that?"

```{r}
# Assuming your data frame is named "obis_seamap_green"
# Replace "latitude" and "longitude" with your actual column names

# Define the latitude and longitude limits for your region of interest
# Adjust the values accordingly to zoom in on your specific region
lat_limit <- c(min(obis_seamap_green$latitude), max(obis_seamap_green$latitude))
lon_limit <- c(min(obis_seamap_green$longitude), max(obis_seamap_green$longitude))

# Create a map focused on your region of interest
ggplot(obis_seamap_green, aes(x = longitude, y = latitude)) +
  geom_polygon(data = world_map, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group), fill = "white", color = "black") +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Map of Latitude and Longitude Points") +
  xlim(lon_limit) + ylim(lat_limit)
```

* That looks terrible! At this point, you could describe the problem to ChatGPT and it will help you. But better yet, is to know about the mapview package. 

* Ask ChatGPT: "Can I use mapview?"

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Install and load the mapview package (if not already installed)
# install.packages("mapview")
library(mapview)

# Assuming your data frame is named "obis_seamap_green"
# Replace "latitude" and "longitude" with your actual column names

# Create a map view
mapview(obis_seamap_green, zcol = NULL, map.types = "OpenStreetMap")
```

* It doesn't work! Tell ChatGPT: "I get an error that says Either convert obis_seamap_green to a spatial object or provide xcol and ycol.
oops! Arguments xcol and/or ycol are missing!" It apologizes and gives you a fix.


```{r}
# Install and load the required packages (if not already installed)
# install.packages("mapview")
# install.packages("sf")
library(mapview)
library(sf)

# Assuming your data frame is named "obis_seamap_green"
# Replace "latitude" and "longitude" with your actual column names

# Convert your data frame to a spatial object
obis_seamap_sf <- st_as_sf(obis_seamap_green, coords = c("longitude", "latitude"))

# Create a map view
mapview(obis_seamap_sf)
```

* Tell ChatGPT: "Better! But the land is not shown"

```{r}
# Assuming your data frame is named "obis_seamap_green"
# Replace "latitude" and "longitude" with your actual column names
library(mapview)
library(sf)

# Convert your data frame to a spatial object
obis_seamap_sf <- st_as_sf(obis_seamap_green, coords = c("longitude", "latitude"))

# Create a map view with Esri.WorldImagery basemap
mapview(obis_seamap_sf, map.types = "Esri.WorldImagery")
```

* Tell ChatGPT: "I get another warning writing: substituting ENGCRS["Undefined Cartesian SRS with unknown unit"] for missing CRS]". It gives us a fix.

```{r}
# Assuming your data frame is named "obis_seamap_green"
# Replace "latitude" and "longitude" with your actual column names
library(mapview)
library(sf)

# Convert your data frame to a spatial object and set the CRS explicitly
obis_seamap_sf <- st_as_sf(obis_seamap_green, coords = c("longitude", "latitude"), crs = 4326)

# Create a map view with Esri.WorldImagery basemap
mapview(obis_seamap_sf, map.types = "Esri.WorldImagery")
```

## Clean up the date

It is common that the date columns are in different formats and we need to change to a format that R will understand.

```{r}
obis_seamap_green$date_time[1]
```

I don't have about the time, I just want date in a standard format. Let's ask ChatGPT.

* "My date_time column looks like this "5/16/16 6:54". I need a date column in a standard format."

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Assuming your data frame is named "obis_seamap_green"
# Replace "date_time" with your actual column name
library(mapview)
library(sf)

# Convert the date_time column to a standard date format
obis_seamap_green$date <- as.Date(obis_seamap_green$date_time, format = "%m/%d/%y %H:%M")

# Remove the original date_time column if needed
obis_seamap_green <- obis_seamap_green[, !names(obis_seamap_green) %in% "date_time"]
```

Let's check if it worked.

```{r}
obis_seamap_green$date[1]
class(obis_seamap_green$date)
```

## Save the data frame

Many times we do a bit of work on our data by cleaning up an such. Once we are done, we should save our data so we can load it in easily later.

First we make a R script that shows how we created our data. We do this to be nice to our "future" selves. Create a R script and save in the data folder as `create-obis-seamap-green.R`.
```
library(readr)
obis_seamap_green <- read_csv("data/obis_seamap_green.csv", 
    skip = 2)
obis_seamap_green$date <- as.Date(obis_seamap_green$date_time, format = "%m/%d/%y %H:%M")

# Remove the original date_time column if needed
obis_seamap_green <- obis_seamap_green[, !names(obis_seamap_green) %in% "date_time"]
```

Now that we have recorded how we made our file, we save our data to a file.

```{r}
save(obis_seamap_green, file="data/obis_seamap_green.RData")
```

Next time we want to load these data we can run
```{r}
load("data/obis_seamap_green.RData")
```



## Summary

1. You learned how to import csv and Excel files using the Import widget. Tip: use NA for missing values!

2. You learned how to interact with ChatGPT as your personal coding helper. Tip: We are using tidyverse so let it know that you want that. Use "only show code" if you don't want all the narrative.

3. In order to work with ChatGPT, you need to be able to tell it what your data look like. Core commands you need to know:

    * Class `class(object)`
    * Column names `colnames(object)`
    * Size `dim(object)`
    
    Use these commands to learn what to tell ChatGPT.
    
4. You learned how to ask ChatGPT to help you plot and how to tell it what the problems are so it can help you. You learned about the mapview R package. ChatGPT knows about it, but rarely will it suggest it on it's own.

5. You made a (boring) plot with the ggplot2 plotting package. This is part of the tidyverse. It is 2023, we use ggplot2 for plotting not base R (`plot()`). We will cover much more plotting with ggplot2 in another tutorial.

## Your turn!

Import some of the other files in the `data` directory.
