## Background

Study of coastal upwelling dynamics using image machine-learning algorithms applied to remote-sensing data
PI: Eli Holmes, Northwest Fisheries Science Center, NOAA Fisheries, Seattle WA

Coastal upwelling is a key driver of productive fisheries. It is largely driven by coastal winds that produce wind stress perpendicular to the coast. This wind stress pulls surface water away from the coast and pulls deep, cold, nutrient rich water to the surface. Strong and consistent coastal upwelling happens in specific regions around the world and supports strong fisheries in these regions. An interesting and curious aspect of upwelling is that it is influenced by ocean-atmosphere teleconnections—correlations in ocean climate across long-distances. In plain language, it means that a pattern that arises in one part of the world’s oceans will be seen later on the other side of the world in a very different part of the world. One of these teleconnections is between temperature anomalies in the North Atlantic Ocean and coastal upwelling in the Arabian Sea.

In this project, we are exploring the use of machine learning and image machine learning to study relationships between coastal upwelling and the physical oceanography of the Arabian Sea. The goal is to explore whether these approaches provide a promising way to develop predictive models for upwelling intensity. For the project, we are using Python libraries for implementing neural networks with image inputs, including TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras.
